/* the CPU accesses memory using buses. The memory is divided into
three parts, ROM inside the cartridges, the CPUâ€™s RAM and the I/O registers. The address
bus is used to set the address of the required location. The control bus is used to inform the
components whether the request is a read or a write. The data bus is used to read or write
the byte to the selected address. Note that ROM is read-only and is accessed via a MMC, to
allow bank switching to occur. The I/O registers are used to communicate with the other
components of the system, the PPU and the control devices */
